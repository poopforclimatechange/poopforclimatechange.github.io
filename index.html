          <p class="card-text">
            Climate deniers are increasingly triggered at our peaceful protesting of climate change in the streets. Our dancing is halting the movement of their fossil fuel burning machinations through our cities. More attention needs to be drawn to the death of the nature around us.
            <br /><br />
            Protesting and activism is about generating attention, allowing us to create a dialogue with the world around us. Some people find inconvenience in our message as we block the streets, take to the parks and consume their social media feeds.
            <br /><br />
            Pooping on the streets is a unique and carbon positive way to spread this message.
            <br /><br />
            Reasons why to poop for climate change:
            <ul>
            <li>Pooping is natural for all beings, which we are trying to save from extinction. #ExtinctionRebellion</li>
            <li>Your poop will draw the attention from all around, creating your moment to spread your message. Never before has the individual been so empowered to make their mark.</li>
            <li>Your poop requires no generators, no signs, confetti or glitter; just poop. After which it will return to the earth and fertilise the trees which are the lungs of the earth.</li>
            <li>As authorities are clamping down on protesters, arresting us, charging us for the love of our earth, we need to be as mobile as ever. A “poop and run” allows the individual protester to be mobile, evading capture of any angered law enforcement.</li>
            </ul>
            The earth needs us. The earth needs, our poop. Poop for climate change today. #ExtinctionRebellion
